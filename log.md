### Day 0: June 6, 2020
Started over on my 100 days of code journey
**Today's Progress**: Used VS Code for the first time in weeks and watched lecture for week 1 CS50 edXHarvard. Also went through a tutorial here https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/git-push-pull to re-familiarize myself with using command line to commit to git

**Thoughts:** I really struggled to remember all that I learned a few weeks ago. I need to work every day to become proficient.
